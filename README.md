# Pig_dice_Game

I created that game as a part of [The Complete JavaScript Course 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). I used HTML and CSS for the grafical interface, and JavaScript for the functionality of the game.
I developed the game to be familiar with the JavaScript click events.

## Game Rules

The game is played with two players. Each player on his turn has three choices.
  - To roll the dice.
    - He can roll the dice as many times as he wants and increase his current score. But if he brings a one, the current score will reset to zero and he will lose his turn.
  - To hold the current score.
    - He adds the current score to his total score. The other player can play.
  - To set new game.
  
 The first player who will score 100 points wins the game.
